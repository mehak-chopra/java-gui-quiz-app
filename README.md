# ✨ Java GUI Quiz App

hii 👀 so this is a lil quiz app I made using Java Swing (ik right?? we coding GUIs now lol).  
It pulls questions from a `.csv` file and tells you if you got 'em right or wrong, on the spot 🔥

made this just to get comfy with GUI + file handling stuff 🧃


## 💡 features
- simple + clean interface
- loads questions from `questions.csv`
- gives feedback after every question (no ghosting here)
- score popup at the end 🎯


## 🛠️ how to run it
1. make sure Java is installed 
2. clone this repo or download the files
3. compile it:
   javac QuizGUI.java
5. Run the app:
   java QuizGUI

   
## 🗂️ files inside
- `QuizGUI.java` → the main code
- `questions.csv` → all the quiz questions
- `.gitignore` → to keep those messy `.class` files outta here 
  

## ✨ extra
pls ignore any yellow squiggly lines VS Code throws at you, they’re just being dramatic 🙄
